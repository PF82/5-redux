Redux

As applications grow in size and scope, managing shared data becomes much more difficult. Redux is defined as a "predictable state container for JavaScript apps" that helps ensure your apps work predictably, and are easier to test.

While you can use Redux with any view library, we introduce Redux here before combining it with React in the next set of courses.

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of Redux stores, actions, reducers and middleware to manage data throughout your application.
